# Student Average & Topper Finder

A simple Python program that calculates the average marks of students and identifies the topper based on the highest average score.

## 📌 Features

* Stores student marks using a dictionary
* Calculates average marks for each student
* Identifies the student with the highest average
* Displays clear and readable output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Run the program using:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to practice basic Python concepts such as dictionaries, loops, conditional logic, and clean output formatting.

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Handle multiple toppers with the same average
* Improve input validation
* Make the program interactive
